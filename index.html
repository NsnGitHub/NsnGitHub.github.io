          <h4>Hi, I'm Anson.</h4>
          <p>An aspiring software engineer currently enrolled in BCIT's Computer Systems Technology program.</p>
          <p>
            Before all of this, I was a business student at SFU concentrating in either Finance or Accounting.
            I enjoyed working with numbers and data in order to gain insights and solve problems, but I didn't
            enjoy the other parts of it, so I thought about what I truly wanted to study.
          </p>
          <p>
            About a year ago, I stumbled upon competitive programming videos on YouTube and I loved seeing how
            people used code to solve complex problems. It was at this point where I taught myself C++ and made
            my way through beginner problems on Codeforces. After about two months, I realized that I was
            passionate about create code to solve all of these problems, and that I enjoy doing so for a living.
            So I decided to pause my education at SFU to pursue a career in software development.
